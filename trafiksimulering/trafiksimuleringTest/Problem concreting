1. Make the Lane class print out on which positions in the lane there are cars
1.1 Put a car on the first position in the lane
1.2 Step the lane forward and put a new car on the second position
1.3 Recursive: step the lane forward a number of times equal to the number of car positions in the lane
1.4 Begin the move forward action from the side of the lane(s) closest to the lights and until the end of the lane like above
1.5 Let r0 be the lane reaching the right light on the right side in the travel direction and let lane r1 be parallel with it on its left side reaching the left light
1.6 Let r2 be the single lane reaching the two parallel lanes r0 and r1
1.7 Thus when a car reaches the last position in r0 it can either go to r0 or r1 depending on the Car's DESTINATION.
1.8 If a car wants to go onto r0 but it is already occupied by a car, it will go onto r1 if possible, and vice versa
1.9 If both first positions in r0 and r1 are occupied then the car can't move forward.
2.0 If the car that is currently being targeted for the forward stepping action is in the wrong lane and the next position in the parallel lane is empty, it will TURN to that lane's position.
